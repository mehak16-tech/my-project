PROJECT: Library Management UI with Search, Add, and Remove Book Functionality
1) Technologies Used:
  a) React: For building a dynamic and component-based user interface.
  b) JavaScript (ES6+): For handling the application's logic, state, and user interactions.
  c) CSS3: For styling the components, layout, and creating a clean user experience.
  d) Vite: As the build tool for a fast and modern development workflow.


2) Project Overview:
  a) This project is an interactive single-page application for managing a book library.
  b) It demonstrates core React principles by allowing users to view, search, add, and remove books from a list dynamically, without any page reloads.
  c) The primary goal was to practice state management, event handling, and component communication in a real-world scenario.
  d) This application serves as a strong foundation for understanding how to build data-driven UIs in React.


3) Project File Structure:
The project is organized into a modular structure, with each component responsible for a specific piece of the UI, making the code clean and scalable.

4) Structure:
  React Components & State Management:
    The application is built around a central "smart" component (LibraryManagement.jsx) that holds the application's state and passes data and functions down to "dumb" presentational components.

    Snippets:
      i) LibraryManagement.jsx (Stateful Container): This is the core of the app. It manages the list of books and the search query using React's useState hook. All logic for adding, removing, and filtering books resides here. SNIPPET (LibraryManagement.jsx):

          function LibraryManagement() {
            const [books, setBooks] = useState([
              { id: 1, title: '1984', author: 'George Orwell' },
                // ... more books
           ]);

            const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
            const handleAddBook = ({ title, author }) => {
              // ... logic to add a book
            };
            
            const handleRemoveBook = (idToRemove) => {
              // ... logic to remove a book
            };
              // ... filtering logic and JSX
          }

      ii) SearchBar.jsx (Controlled Component): A simple component that receives the current search query and a function to update it. This is a classic example of a controlled component. SNIPPET (SearchBar.jsx):

          function SearchBar({ searchQuery, onSearchChange }) {
             return (
              <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="Search by title or author"
                value={searchQuery}
                onChange={(e) => onSearchChange(e.target.value)}
              />
            );
          }

      iii) AddBookForm.jsx (Form Handling): This component manages its own internal state for the title and author input fields. When the form is submitted, it calls a function passed down from LibraryManagement with the new book's data. SNIPPET (AddBookForm.jsx):

          function AddBookForm({ onAddBook }) {
            const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
            const [author, setAuthor] = useState('');
            const handleSubmit = (event) => {
              event.preventDefault();
              onAddBook({ title, author });
              // ... clear inputs
            };
            // ... form JSX
          }

       iv) BookList.jsx & BookItem.jsx (Dynamic Rendering): BookList receives the filtered list of books and maps over it, rendering a BookItem component for each book. This demonstrates how to render lists of data dynamically. BookItem is responsible for displaying a single book's details and its "Remove" button. SNIPPET (BookItem.jsx):

          function BookItem({ book, onRemove }) {
            return (
              <div className="book-item">
                <span>
                  <strong>{book.title}</strong> by {book.author}
                </span>
                <button onClick={() => onRemove(book.id)}>
                  Remove
                </button>
              </div>
            );
          }


5) Learning Outcomes:
  a) Mastered the use of the useState hook to manage and update component state.
  b) Gained practical experience with a component-based architecture, breaking down a complex UI into small, reusable pieces.
  c) Understood how to pass data and functions from parent to child components using props ("lifting state up").
  d) Implemented robust event handling for forms (onSubmit), buttons (onClick), and inputs (onChange).
  e) Learned to create dynamic and interactive UIs by filtering arrays and re-rendering components based on state changes.


6) Key Concepts:
  a) React State Management (useState)
  b) Component Composition & Reusability
  c) Props for Unidirectional Data Flow
  d) Controlled Components for Forms and Inputs
  e) Handling User Events
  f) Conditional & List Rendering (.filter, .map)
