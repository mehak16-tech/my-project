Learning Outcomes:
a) I learned how to use Flexbox to center content both vertically and horizontally on the screen.
b) I understood how CSS styling like padding, shadows, and border-radius can improve UI design.
c) I practiced creating a clean and structured HTML layout for better readability and future updates.
d) I also learned how to give a professional look to a simple project using only basic frontend tools (HTML & CSS).

Snippets:
a) Flexbox Centering : Used to center the whole layout in the middle of the screen.
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.buttons {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 12px;
}

c) Deposit Button Styling : Green button used for deposit action.
.deposit {
  background-color: #28a745;
}

d) Withdraw Button Styling : Red button used for withdraw action.
.withdraw {
  background-color: #dc3545;
}

e) Button Base Style : Makes all buttons smooth, clickable, and modern-looking.
button {
  border: none;
  border-radius: 8px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

f) Connecting CSS File : Links the external CSS file to the HTML page.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
