PROJECT: Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid Layout & Theme Switching
1) Technologies Used:
  a) HTML5
  b) CSS3 (Grid Layout, Custom Properties, Media Queries)

2) Project Overview:
  a) In this experiment, I created a responsive Admin Dashboard layout using CSS Grid, combined with a simple yet effective dark/light theme switcher using only HTML and CSS — no JavaScript was used.
  b) This kind of layout can be used in admin panels, CMS dashboards, or internal tools.
  c) The interface is structured into four main sections: Header, Navigation Sidebar, Main Content, and Footer, all managed via CSS Grid layout for clean alignment and adaptability across screen sizes.

3) Theme Switch (Dark Mode)
   Implemented a functional dark mode using a hidden checkbox toggle that, when selected, changes CSS custom properties (--variables) to apply darker tones across the layout. 
   This enhances user accessibility and visual comfort.

4) Structural Breakdown:
  a) Header:
    i) Contains title (Admin Dashboard) and the dark mode toggle label.
   ii) Uses Flexbox for horizontal alignment and spacing.
  iii) Stretches across the full width of the grid (2 columns).
      
      Snippet):Spans full grid width using Flexbox for title & toggle alignment.
               <header>
                <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
                <label for="theme-switch">Dark Mode</label>
               </header>

  b) Navigation Bar:
     i) Vertical menu with three links: Home, Users, and Settings.
    ii) Styled with light background and adequate padding for clarity.

         Snippet): Vertical sidebar menu styled with padding and light background.
                 <nav>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Users</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Settings</a></li>
                  </ul>
                 </nav>

  c) Main Section:
     i) Displays a welcome message and placeholder for charts/reports.
    ii) Background color adapts based on the selected theme.

       Snippet): Main content area adapts its colors based on theme selection.
               <main>
                <h2>Welcome, Admin!</h2>
                <p>...Add charts or reports here...</p>
               </main>

  d) Footer:
    i) Unified bottom section with copyright.
   ii) Styled to match header and also spans both grid columns.

      Snippet):Footer stretches across grid, centered using Flexbox.
              <footer>
                <p>© 2025 Admin Panel</p>
              </footer>

        
5) Learning Outcomes:
  a) Gained practical understanding of CSS Grid Layout for building responsive page structures.
  b) Learnt to implement dark/light themes without JavaScript using :checked selector and CSS variables.
  c) Explored how to control layout using a combination of Grid and Flexbox for a clean UI.
  d) Improved knowledge of reusable CSS practices via :root and custom properties.

6) Key Concepts:
  a) Responsive Grid Layout
  b) Flexbox Alignment
  c) Custom CSS Variables
  d) Theme Toggling with Pure CSS
  e) Semantic HTML Structure.
