AI-POWERED CHATBOT USING MERN STACK AND GEMINI API
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

--->Project Title:
AI-Powered Chatbot Integration into MERN Application using Gemini API

--->Objective:
To design and integrate an AI chatbot into a MERN stack web application that uses Google Gemini API for intelligent conversation handling, real-time streaming, and secure user interaction.

--->Goal:
Build a complete full-stack application capable of real-time AI communication with persistent conversation history, authentication, and context management.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Traditional chatbots often rely on predefined responses, lacking adaptability and real-time intelligence.
The challenge is to create a dynamic chatbot that:
⦁	Connects to Gemini API for advanced AI interactions.
⦁	Maintains session context and memory per user.
⦁	Provides streamed responses for a natural chat flow.
⦁	Persists all data in a MongoDB database securely.

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The project follows a MERN architecture:

⦁	MongoDB: Stores user sessions, chat history, and metadata.
⦁	Express (Node.js): Acts as a backend server and API layer connecting React and Gemini API.
⦁	React: Provides the interactive front-end chat
⦁	Node.js: Handles server-side operations, authentication, and message routing.
⦁	Communication between React frontend and Node backend happens via REST APIs and SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time token streaming.

└── Description/


Explanation:

⦁	chatbot_mehak_chat: Backend (Node + Express) with Gemini API logic and MongoDB connection.
⦁	gemini-react-app: Frontend built with React for chat UI and real-time updates.
⦁	screenshots: Contains demonstration and testing images.
⦁	Description: Documentation and project notes.
⦁	.env: Environment variables (Gemini API key, Mongo URI, JWT secret).

5. FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS
A. Provider Abstraction
⦁	Uses a service layer for Gemini API with flexible request/response handling.
⦁	Configurable parameters (model, temperature, timeout).
⦁	Easily extensible to other AI providers in future.

B. Context & Memory

⦁	Session-based history management using MongoDB.
⦁	Auto-summarization for long conversations to save tokens.
⦁	Functions for clearing, resetting, or attaching system prompts dynamically.

C. Streaming APIs

⦁	/chat endpoint created with Server-Sent Events (SSE).
⦁	Streams partial responses token by token for smoother experience.
⦁	Heartbeat and backpressure handling for connection stability.

D. React Chat UI

⦁	Built with React.js and includes:
⦁	Typing indicators and live streaming messages.
⦁	Retry and error handling options.
⦁	Timestamps and grouped message display.
⦁	Context controls (clear/summarize/reset).

E. Persistence

⦁	MongoDB collections for users, sessions, and chat logs.
⦁	TTL (Time-To-Live) for inactive sessions.
⦁	Option to export or download full conversations.

F. Safety & Guardrails

⦁	Prompt injection filtering and input sanitization.
⦁	Rate limiting per user session.
⦁	Environment-based secret management.

G. Authentication & Security

⦁	JWT-based user authentication.
⦁	CORS and CSRF protection enabled.
⦁	Secure cookie-based sessions or headers.

H. Observability & Monitoring

⦁	Metrics for latency, API errors, and token usage.
⦁	Logging with correlation IDs for debugging.
⦁	Cost tracking for per-user AI usage.

I. Testing

⦁	Mock Gemini provider for local testing.
⦁	Unit and integration tests for backend routes.
⦁	E2E (End-to-End) testing of conversation flow and persistence.

J. DevOps & Deployment

⦁	Docker Compose setup for easy deployment.
⦁	Environment-driven configurations for dev/test/prod.
⦁	Seed scripts for demo sessions and testing data.

7. CSS & FRONTEND DESIGN OVERVIEW

⦁	ELEMENT: Chat Container (Main UI Box)
⦁	background-color: #ffffff; — clean chat box appearance
⦁	border-radius: 10px; — smooth curved edges
⦁	box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); — raised effect
⦁	ELEMENT: Message Bubbles
⦁	User messages: light blue (#d0e7ff)
⦁	Bot messages: light gray (#f1f1f1)
⦁	padding: 10px; and margin: 5px; for spacing
⦁	ELEMENT: Input Field
⦁	Full-width input box with rounded corners
⦁	border: 1px solid #ccc; for separation
⦁	padding: 12px; font-size: 16px; for usability
⦁	ELEMENT: Send Button
⦁	background-color: #4a90e2; color: white; — visually prominent
⦁	border-radius: 5px; — consistent design
⦁	cursor: pointer; — clear interactivity

8. WORKFLOW

⦁	User opens the React chat interface.
⦁	Sends a mssage → React sends it to backend /chat endpoint.
⦁	Node.js Express server processes and forwards it to Gemini API.
⦁	Gemini API responds with tokens (streamed in real time).
⦁	Backend streams response using SSE/WebSocket to frontend.
⦁	MongoDB saves full conversation and session details.
⦁	User can clear chat, summarize context, or continue chatting.

9. RESULTS

⦁	Successfully implemented real-time streaming chat with Gemini API.
⦁	Achieved secure JWT-based authentication.
⦁	Persistent session memory and summarization working correctly.
⦁	Optimized token usage and latency performance.
⦁	Developed a clean, responsive React UI for chat interactions.
